            <h1>The Bad Album Review Contest - Voting </h1>

            <!-- #1 -->
            <div class="review-entry">
                <h2>Entry 1: "Refused - The Shape Of Punk To Come" </h2>
                <p>First I’d like to review the cover art for the album. Some random shapes surrounding some even more random images, with the text “A Chimerical Abomination In 12 Bursts” above it. For a band that is trying to prove a point they’re not very good at symbolizing it visually. </p>

                    <h4><b>Initial thoughts for each track</b></h4>
                    <p><b>Worms Of The Senses / Faculties Of The Skull</b> - Cringe intro quote followed by nails on a chalkboard. <br>
                    <b>Liberation Frequency</b> - Liberate me from hearing this frequency <br>
                    <b>The Deadly Rhythm</b> - The deadly rhythm seriously killed my ears <br>
                    <b>Summerholidays vs. Punkroutine</b> - Who thought it was a good idea to make punk poppy. And why is Dennis Lyxzén trying to actually sing <br>
                    <b>Bruitist Pome #5</b> - Best song of the album and coincidentally it’s the only song with no singing and also the shortest song of the album <br>
                    <b>Noise</b> - Nothing new about “new noise”. Sounds just like regular noise to me. <br>
                    <b>The Refused Party Program</b> - Wow, a hardcore punk band trying to make a statement about an ideology as dead as their genre. Definitely didn’t see this coming <br>
                    <b>Protest Song ‘68</b> - The message didn’t go through with the previous song? <br>
                    <b>Refused Are Fucking Dead</b> - Well at least they’re aware, unless they are talking about necrophilia <br>
                    <b>The Shape Of Punk To Come</b> - Being the title track you’d expect it to be at least a little bit memorable <br>
                    <b>Tannhäuser / Derivè</b> - “This thing sucks” you think. Your eyes accidentally catch a glimpse of the remaining time. 8 minutes of torture. This is one of those moments when you wonder if life is really worth living.<br>
                    <b>The Apollo Programme Was A Hoax</b> - Yeah let’s end with a jazzy song just so we can call it a “revolutionary album”. And let’s have Dennis Lyxzén sing through a Nokia 3310 to make the vibe feel more authentic or whatever.<br>
                    
                    Wanted to rip my ears out for 55 minutes straight. Thanks a lot Refused! Wouldn’t even recommend to my worst enemy.</p>

                <h2>Entry 2: "Hozier - Unreal Unearth" </h2>
                <p>Unreal Unearth feels like Hozier spent way too much time sitting by a foggy lake, overthinking every emotion he’s ever had. Each song sounds like it was made for the most dramatic rain-soaked scene in a movie—where the main character just walks aimlessly, staring into the distance. The whole album is like an endless loop of “I’m deep and mysterious,” but after a while, you start wondering if even Hozier knows what he’s talking about anymore. <br>

                    The pace of the album is painfully slow, like a turtle doing yoga. You keep waiting for something to pick up, but it never happens—just more soft guitar and Hozier whispering poetic phrases about the sky, the sea, and probably a rock he found once that made him sad. Every track feels like it’s desperately trying to be profound, but instead, it just leaves you feeling like you need a nap. If you’re hoping for a feel-good jam, you’re out of luck—this is more like a soundtrack for staring out a window and pondering your entire existence <br>
                    But hey, let’s be real Hozier is still that guy. The man could probably sing the phone book and we’d all sit there nodding like it’s the most profound thing we’ve ever heard. Sure, Unreal Unearth feels like an emotional marathon through a damp forest, but you can’t help but respect the dedication. No one else could make singing about sad rocks sound so elegant. So, Hozier, we get it you’re deep, mysterious, and probably have meaningful thoughts about moss. Just maybe next time, throw us a lifeline, or at least one track we can tap our foot to before we drown in our own feelings.</p>

                <h2>Entry 3: "Arctic Monkeys - The Car" </h2>
                <p> Not the joyride you would expect <br><br>

                    First, I want to get something out of the way: I have nothing against cars. Arguably one of the more important modern inventions. I would even go so far as to say, I personally have a lot to thank cars for. If it wasn’t for these four wheeled vehicles and their huge role in my life, I wouldn’t even be writing this top-quality review. True, I also likely wouldn’t be familiar with Arctic Monkey’s 7th studio album, The Car, and maybe I would have a little more of my sanity left. Just like its namesake, this production also left a lasting mark on my life, but not the kind I cherish. Listening to this 37-minute ordeal, one gets to experience how it must feel to be the most pretentious person on this planet. Under the layers of bloated vocals and obscure lyrics there’s not much left, just an insecure man who came up with yet another character to hide behind – this time he is more insufferable than ever, even if you can’t really understand anything he says. If we stay at the imagery – and try not to be fooled by the deceivingly chosen album cover with the humble Toyota Camry – this album is definitely a Yugo. Copied off of a well-loved Fiat model, built of the cheapest and tackiest parts in the most inconsiderate and sloppy way, imposed on international audiences by an error-prone entrepreneur, just to make the history books as “the worst car ever”, I see no differences between the life-cycle of this unfortunate automobile and the musical fever dream one is subjected to once gathering the courage to press the play button. I’d argue the Yugo is still only the runner up on the list of most harmful imported products after its sonic twin, and if The Car would be picked up and tossed over the railing of the Mackinaw Bridge by heavy gust of wind due to its weightless nature, I wouldn’t mourn long, unlike when the same thing happened to my grandfather’s Yugo in the 90s.</p>

                <h2>Entry 4: "Alt-J - An Awesome Wave" </h2>
                <p> Alt-J is a British band formed by students from the liberal arts faculty. Instead of attending classes, they spent their time writing songs, trying to avoid a future working at McDonald's. These songs eventually became their debut album, An Awesome Wave. They certainly didn’t lack confidence, but despite the title, this isn’t an "Awesome Wave"—it’s more like a shallow puddle you should drive through rather than listen to. The lack of creativity is most obvious in the album cover, which looks like a screenshot from Google Maps with a couple of Instagram filters thrown on to make it seem unique (they tried, but it didn’t work). <br> <br>

                    The album matches the cover’s unoriginality. It starts with a track called "Intro", the classic solution for lazy bands (did I mention they studied at the liberal arts faculty?) to make the album longer in the easiest way possible so iTunes doesn’t classify it as an EP and they can sell it for $9.99 as a full album. But Alt-J took it a step further—if you manage to suffer through the "Intro", you’re immediately met with an "Interlude". I honestly don’t think there’s a bigger scam in the music industry than An Awesome Wave. I truly applaud anyone who managed to keep listening after they started, but sadly, there’s no reward waiting for them. <br> <br>
                    
                    Musically and lyrically, "Tessellate" and "Breezeblocks" fall short of what you’d expect after wasting 7 minutes listening to this album. Both songs sound like the band is trying out instruments for the first time. The foundation of both tracks is a simple melody made up of just a few notes. In "Tessellate", it’s easy to tell that the keyboardist was trying to learn "Imagine" by John Lennon, failed, but remembered one of his messed-up attempts. "Breezeblocks" is the same, but on guitar, using the famous riff from "Smoke on the Water". Maybe that was enough to impress some liberal arts girls, but these songs really shouldn’t have been released. Lyrically, both tracks deal with topics that matter to university students: "Tessellate" is about triangles (I imagine the singer’s eyes lighting up during geometry class), and "Breezeblocks" is about the love for Cheetos, reinforced by the repeated lines, "I'll eat you whole, I love you so, I love you so". <br><br>
                    
                    After this, you’re hit with yet another "Interlude" before Alt-J keeps trying (and failing) to seem like a serious band. We get songs like "Something Good" (which isn’t very good), "Dissolve Me," the song about ducks' butts "Ms" (I’m not joking, look it up on YouTube), and "Taro," which is basically a history book vomited into a song. By this point, the guitarist was so out of ideas that he started playing his guitar with duck tape. The last hope for the listener might have been that by the end of the album, the singer would learn how to sing, but naturally, that doesn’t happen. In every song, the vocalist sounds like he’s trying to imitate the noise of a dial-up modem, sometimes paired with lyrics that are just as nonsensical: "Ring la la la la la la la la" in "Fitzpleasure," "Hoo, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh" in "Ms," and "She she she she only ever ver ver ver ver" in the first time-wasting “Interlude". The only way this album could be more predictable and clichéd is if they used the classic ACAB chord progression, but thankfully the "genius" artists didn’t think of that. <br><br>
                    
                    After this album, the bassist left the band, and honestly, I can’t blame him. Alt-J’s second album was titled This Is All Yours. Well, Alt-J, we don’t want it. Take it back.</p>

                <h2>Entry 5: "Interpol - Turn On The Bright Lights" </h2>
                <p>How many post punk revivalists does it take to change a light bulb? <br> 
                    Is certainly not a question Interpol’s debut album Turn on the bright lights holds the answer to, as they produced the music equivalent of being tied down in a dimly lit basement, with a bunch of chain-smoking philosophy major dropouts, who think they’ve just mastered existential dread through being dressed in 9-5 cubicle attire. Making you, the listener, begging for the bright lights to free you from the angst and shower those guilty of a truly harrowing experience. But fret not, this review aims to unmask and shine light upon the sonic wrongs committed by the international spy agency. <br>
                    The first charge is one of uninspired and monotone vocal delivery. Seeing as frontman Paul “Blanks’” voice ranges between a bored substitute teacher giving a lecture on nihilism and the odd offhand sexual remark of a creepy uncle at an easter family gathering. A dead ringer for Ian Curtis, some would say, I say don’t speak ill of the dead.<br>
                    The guitars? They're not even played. I’m figuring they read Wikipedia articles on post-punk revival’s stripped down sound and thought it would excuse a lack of effort. Daniel Kessler’s guitar work could double as the hold music for a dentist’s office blasting through the mixing equivalent of a Nokia brick phone and should shift his focus towards a career in tap dance instead. Granted, his first name rocks, as does his footwork. <br>
                    As for the rhythm section, Carlos D. plays bass like he’s angry that his parents didn't let him get his second ear piercing (it was gonna have a cool satanic cross and everything). His larger than-emo-non-worth living life ego, goes so far as calling the bass lines in this album revolutionary… Given, that more bland and unremarkable bass lines are harder to come by, i'm inclined to agree with his parents and his bass playing, stating that it’s “Just a phase”<br>
                    But who cares about bass anyway?<br>
                    Sam Fogarino's drumming is as exciting as watching matte black eyeliner dry. It’s as if they intentionally decided to play offbeat just to convince you they’re mysterious and “deep” <br>
                    The lyrics are a cryptic Alpha-bits soup of forced high school poetry, penned by someone who just discovered Franz Kafka and is definitely trying way too hard, just to burn out a few months into the semester/tracklist. Proven by the noncoherent lyrics of the track Roland. Which describes a Polish and, uhm, bearded man’s impressively large and illegal knife collection, seemingly also a callback to Paul’s English origin. <br>
                    The songs, in general, are a mess, with no other apparent message than an atmosphere of dank, smokey New York dive bars. “Say hello to the angels” is a great example of a total rip off on Katrina and the Waves’ “Walking on sunshine”. Lyrically it’s not even close to the same level of brilliance. The only parameter they find themselves close to is the BPM with a 7 bpm difference between the two. Ironically enough, the Interpol listening experience is one best described as a beautiful summer day picnic in funeral attire - dressed for gloom, but painfully out of place. <br>
                    And don’t even get me started on Stella… Good on her for not letting herself be defined as always being down. I can only imagine being put in a box by such chauvinists is the reason she broke away (broke away) <br>
                      “I will surprise you sometime,” Banks wanes, but the only surprise here is how a band could turn the vibrant energy of New York City into an audio sedative for a sonic snooze-fest culminating in a self-loathing cigarette induced coma. <br>
                    Turn on the Bright Lights? Turn Off the Entire Album. It's like the lights are too dim to read the room, because surely no one is asking for another 45 minutes of this moody, discordant, cookie cutter production soundscape. The only reason to own this record is if you need an emergency frisbee to fling into the post punk void of despair. <br>
                    In conclusion, Interpol’s Turn on the Bright Lights should come with a warning label: “May induce: raging nicotine addiction and the urge to wear a trenchcoat and pretend you're in a noir film.” Avoid. Or, if you enjoy self-inflicted sonic misery… <br>
                    Bring a defibrillator—Interpol’s attempt at post-punk CPR is all broken ribs, no heartbeat.</p>

             <h2>Entry 6: "The Strokes - First Impressions Of Earth" </h2>
                <p> TW: suicide, drug abuse, racism, terrorism, and "naughty words" <br>  First impressions of earth is weird. The strokers are all as old as my parents but think they are still in their teenager phase; the songs sound like a depressed teenager who just got out of their first relationship and is sad that they get no bitches. This is not their real first impression of earth, because if it was, we would be listening to something more wholesome than stalking, substance abuse, racism and terrorism. Take ''Ask Me Anything,'' it sounds like they took an ask me anything from r/conservative. Some songs in the album are less creepy, but when it seems the main character is becoming content with earth, they fall in a spiral of depression and it seems like all inspiration is lost. They sing about using the same words over and over again. How did they think repeating the same three words 43 times would work? I know Julian worked with daft punk, but they have been around the world 144 times, while this is his ''first impression'' of earth. And they have not been listening the songs from this album because they have problems sleeping, because listening to the same words that much is enough to make you fall asleep. What would you do if you could not sleep? The main character just wants to drink and have sex of course, because what would a teenager do otherwise? Not like they could neutralize enemies or vaporize citi- oh. But in the end all is good, or is it? They finally find someone, but all of the sudden it is all too good to be true and they want it to end just as much as they want to end themselves.</p>

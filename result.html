            "New Zealand": "New Zealand was written on looking beyond the horizon, a track for those who see their world as bigger than just the space they're living in, and ones that are always willing to push past their comfort zone to explore and discover the unknown.",
            "The World Ignores Silent Cries": "The track's title speaks volumes and its choir and gentle piano add to it. It's what it means to feel so much and speak so little. You're the emotional, sensitive one, your heart is on your sleeve and it's how you live; with all of your feelings out there, or in there.",
            "Flora": "You're nothing different from Hverfa's rebel theme song. Just like its revolutionary intro and drive; you're not one to be told what to do, you'd take your rights by your hand and never wail.",
            "Hverfa": "The title track is the definition of inner conflict and self-fight, you're a seeker of what everything means and why everything happens, and you're always occupied by your daily inner turmoil about the purpose of it all.",
            "Myrkur": "This powerful, commanding tune has always been seen as a song of determination and a pioneer's passion to lead and take a step towards better places in the world. You're one that people can lean on for advice and help, a very reliable being.",
            "Even When There's A War, Birds Are Not Silent": "A free-spirited anthem and the song of its people, one for those who seek the justice and will in all of their life aspects. Something this song resembles well in its strong unwailing chorusA free-spirited anthem and the song of its people, one for those who seek justice and will in all of their life aspects. Something this song resembles well in its powerful chorus and outro.",
            "The Greenest Green": "An artistic beauty. The Greenest Green is a flag for those who appreciate life's colours the most. You're known for your creativity and pouring your soul and special characteristics in whatever you do.",
            "Planes III": "This song is like a familiar comforting face that you feel immense warmth and gratitude for their presence. You're your people's guardian, the loving light soul in everyone's lives that encourages them to carry on.",
            "Fata Morgana": "Just Like Fata Morgana's lively beats and tunes, and the outgoing nature of drums, you're the life in your friends' group, the social one that brings everyone together and is the tier of all connections."

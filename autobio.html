            <p>
                I'm JuffBass, a musician from Debrecen, Hungary. My real name is Zoltán, and I’ve always had a deep love for music. I was born on March 6, 1993, and my musical journey began in 2008 when I got my first bass guitar, a Baltimore by Johnson, as a Christmas gift. I’m self-taught and spent countless hours watching and emulating various strumming techniques. Flea from the Red Hot Chili Peppers was one of my early influences, and "Pea" was the first song I learned to play.</p>
            <p>
                Balancing my career with my passion for music has been a bit of a juggling act, but my dedication to the bass guitar became a daily ritual. I’ve always strived to master various styles and techniques, driven by a love for the instrument and a desire to keep improving. My music collection is extensive, and I'm always on the lookout for new inspirations.</p>
            <p>
                In 2012, I started my official YouTube channel, where I began sharing bass covers of my favorite songs. To my surprise, this quickly attracted a small but dedicated community of followers who shared my passion for music. I wanted to give back, so I provided tutorials and bass tabs that I wrote myself for new players, along with a bit of companionship from my Regulus bird plush and my cat. As of June 2024, I’ve managed to share over 300 covers and gathered 43k devoted fellow bassists, with around 14M views.</p>
            <p>
                By 2017, I felt ready to create something of my own, leading to my first instrumental bass album, Moments With Birds, released on May 22, 2018. This album was a collection of my original tracks and a reflection of my style.</p>
            <p>
                After my debut album, I released Evenings On A Balcony in 2018. I wanted these songs to be a bit easier to listen to or a little faster while still maintaining a calming atmosphere. It seems this approach resonated with listeners, which was incredibly encouraging.</p>
            <p>
                In the subsequent years,  I kept exploring my sound and production techniques. My third album, Hiraeth (2020), delved into deeper, more personal themes, drawing from the Welsh concept of homesickness and longing. I also experimented with programmed drums in my music. Farewell Flight (2021) was a special project for me, as it was my last album featuring only bass and drums. Each track was carefully crafted, so it took me several months to complete.</p>
            <p>
                I started embracing new instruments and sounds with Monolith in 2022, my first album prominently featuring electric guitars. I announced it on my birthday, describing it as "more complex, less repetitive, and more calming to listen to." It was heartening to see critics appreciate the careful composition and unique mixing.</p>
            <p>
                On May 31, 2023, I was thrilled to reach 20K listens on Spotify. Following this, I announced my latest album, Emptiness Reigns. Released after a year and two days of dedicated work, this album features a fuller instrumentation, including bass guitar, piano, synths, and violins. I dedicated Emptiness Reigns to my late cat, Gombóc, whose meowing is preserved in the track "Serene Reverie," a small way to keep his memory alive.</p>
            <p>
             Now, in 2024, I'm excited for what’s next. I’m planning to release a new album by the end of the year. So far, I’ve released three singles, "New Zealand", "Myrkur", and "Flora". This upcoming album will mark a significant expansion in my musical range, incorporating choir elements, heavier songs, and more complex production techniques. I’m also revisiting and reworking older songs from my previous albums, giving them a new approach and a fuller, more developed sound. </p>
